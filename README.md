# Peru_lambda
This repository was created to permnently store data related to the publication "The Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 Variant Lambda (C.37) in South America" [doi:10.1101/2021.06.26.21259487](10.1101/2021.06.26.21259487).
The folder **Phylogenetics** contains the files `builds.yaml` and `config.yaml` to run the Nextstrain pipeline, `lambda.R` to pre-process the metadata before the Nextstrain pipeline, and selected output files of the pipeline. The graphic ouput can be see in https://nextstrain.org/community/quipupe/Peru_lambda?c=variant. 
Computational experiments were performed at Centro de Alto Rendimiento Computacional de la Amazonía Peruana del Instituto de Investigaciones de la Amazonía Peruana. More information: http://www.iiap.gob.pe/web/manati.aspx/. We acknowledge colleagues in the laboratories that generated and shared genetic sequence data via the GISAID Initiative, on which this study is based.
